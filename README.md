For Delphi projects, if the project contains source code and related dependencies, then theoretically it can be compiled and run locally using the Delphi compiler. In addition, if the project also contains the necessary runtime environment and library files, then you can run the compiled application directly after configuring the appropriate development environment. Therefore, for the above project, it is recommended to download Delphi first, then download the files and then run them with Delphi.
The following are the step-by-step described (Run KMEDHEA as an example):
